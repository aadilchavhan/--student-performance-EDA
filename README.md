![Student Performance Heatmap](https://github.com/aadilchavhan/student-performance-EDA/blob/main/Correlation%20Heatmap%20of%20Student%20Performance.png)

## Overview  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **statistical visualization** of student performance data. By analyzing key factors such as study habits, attendance, and socioeconomic background, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can help improve academic success.  

## Objectives  
- Conduct an in-depth **exploratory data analysis** of student performance.  
- Utilize **statistical visualization** techniques to identify trends and patterns.  
- Provide insights into key factors affecting student achievements.  

## Dataset  
The dataset includes various attributes related to student grades, demographics, parental influence, and external factors impacting academic performance.  

## Tools & Libraries  
This project makes use of the following technologies:  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization.  
- **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing (if needed).  

## Key Findings  
- Relationship between **study hours** and **academic performance**.  
- Influence of **parental education level** on student success.  
- Effect of **attendance** and **school environment** on grades.
