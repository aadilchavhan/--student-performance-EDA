## **Overview**  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **statistical visualization** of student performance data. By analyzing key factors such as study habits, attendance, and socioeconomic background, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can help improve academic success.  

## **Dataset Information**  
- **Dataset Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Student Performance](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)  
- The dataset consists of student records with various attributes such as **study time, parental education, and test scores**, providing valuable insights into factors affecting academic outcomes.  

## **Objective**  
The objective of this lab activity is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **statistical visualization** on student performance data. The analysis aims to uncover key patterns, correlations, and insights that affect student academic performance.  

## **Tools & Libraries**  
This project makes use of the following technologies:  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing (if needed)  

## **Key Findings**  
- Relationship between **study hours** and **academic performance**  
- Influence of **parental education level** on student success  
- Effect of **attendance** and **school environment** on grades
